# Migrating On-Premises Users to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  

## Overview  
This repository and it's article - https://medium.com/@nanabrown.agyir/user-migration-into-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-2a40a7bb70ee - provides a step-by-step guide, scripts, and resources for migrating on-premises user identities into AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). By centralizing user management in AWS, organizations can enhance security, simplify access control, and streamline operations for cloud-based environments.  

## Features  
- **Automated Migration Scripts**: Streamlined user data export and import process.  
- **Custom IAM Policy Examples**: Predefined policies for role-based access control.  
- **Best Practices Documentation**: Guidelines for secure and efficient migration.  
- **Testing and Validation Tools**: Scripts and tips to verify user access post-migration.  

## Prerequisites  
- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have access to AWS Management Console with IAM permissions.  
- **On-Premises Directory**: Export user data in a compatible format (e.g., CSV).  
- **AWS CLI Installed**: For executing migration scripts.  
- **Python 3.x** (optional): Required for running the provided utility scripts.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NanaAgyirBrown/migrating-onprem-users.git
   cd migrating-onprem-users
   ```  
2. Install dependencies (if any):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## Usage  

### 1. **Export Users from On-Premises System**  
Export your user data to a CSV file. Ensure the CSV includes the following fields:  
- `Username`  
- `Email`  
- `Role`  
- `Group`  

### 2. **Configure AWS CLI**  
Set up the AWS CLI with appropriate credentials:  
```bash
aws configure  
```  

### 3. **Run the Migration Script**  
Execute the script to migrate users:  
```bash
python migrate_users.py --input users.csv  
```  

### 4. **Validate Migration**  
Verify the migrated users in the AWS IAM Console or using the CLI:  
```bash
aws iam list-users  
```

└── requirements.txt         # Dependencies  
```  

## Best Practices  
- **Test in a Sandbox Environment**: Use a test AWS account to avoid impacting production systems.  
- **Adopt MFA**: Enable multi-factor authentication for all migrated users.  
- **Implement Least Privilege**: Assign minimal permissions necessary for users to perform their roles.
